# DataVisualization

In W209, Data Visualization, our class completed assignments in javascript and tableau.  Our final project was a tableau report that enabled users to expore the correlation between state gun laws and the gun violence rates.  We performed several rounds of user experience testing and modified our design to make a better experience.
